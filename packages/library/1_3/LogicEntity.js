    //! An array of tags for this entity. Tags are used for many things, from
    //! marking an entity defined in the 3D editor for easy fetching in scripting,
    //! to grouping of entities, to managing persistence.
    //!
    //! Persistence can be managed by tags, as a way to decide
    //! which entities are persistent and which are transient. For example, when
    //! editing a map the characters editing it are transient - we don't want them
    //! to be saved when we do a save of the map. But we do want entities like lights,
    //! particle effects, mapmodels, etc., to persist in such a way.
    //!
    //! A more complex example is where we have a 'template' for a map, like say
    //! a generic office room. We them customize it, and want only the new entities
    //! we created to persist, but not the 'template' entities - these are for us
    //! fixed, immutable - and not the editing characters - these are for us transient.
    //!
    //! Persistence tags are simply normal tags. Example tags might be 'transient',
    //! 'template', 'map', etc. etc. - completely user defined. Then, when the map
    //! entities are saved, we can specify which tags to save.
